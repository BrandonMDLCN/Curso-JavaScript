/*
The first rule is simple. If we declare any variable or constant using "let" or "const", respectively, outside the code blocks, they will be global.
By this we mean that their names will be visible throughout the program, outside blocks, inside blocks, in functions, and so on.

What happens if we declare something using let or const inside a block? 
This will create a local variable or constant.
It will be visible only inside the block in which it was declared and in blocks that can optionally be nested in it.
Let's look at a simple example:
*/

let height = 180;
{
    let weight = 70;
    console.log(height); // -> 180
    console.log(weight); // -> 70
}
console.log(height); // -> 180
console.log(weight); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: weight is not defined

//We can also test the case with nested blocks:
let height = 200;
{
    let weight = 100;
    {
        let info = "tall";
        console.log(height); // -> 200
        console.log(weight); // -> 100
        console.log(info); // -> tall
    }
    console.log(height); // -> 200
    console.log(weight); // -> 100
    console.log(info); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: info is not defined
   }

/* -----------------------------------------------*/
/*                        var                    */
/* ---------------------------------------------*/
/*
In the case of variable declarations using the keyword var, the situation is slightly different.

The variable declared using it outside the blocks will, as in the case of let, be global and accessible from anywhere.
If you declare it inside a block, then... well, it will usually turn out to be global again.
*/
var height = 180;
{
    var weight = 70;
    console.log(height); // -> 180
    console.log(weight); // -> 70
}
console.log(height); // -> 180
console.log(weight); // -> 70

/*
As expected, both variables, height and weight, turn out to be global. 
Will the variables declared using var always, regardless of the place of declaration, be global? Definitely not.

var ignores ordinary program blocks, treating them as if they do not exist.

So in what situation can we declare a local variable using var? Only inside a function.
*/

var globalGreeting = "Good ";
   
function testFunction() {
    var localGreeting = "Morning ";
    console.log("function:");
    console.log(globalGreeting);
    console.log(localGreeting);
}
   
testFunction();
   
console.log("main program:");
console.log(globalGreeting);
console.log(localGreeting); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: localGreeting is not defined


/*
In the local scope, in which we declare a local variable using its name, 
we will have access to the local value 
(the global variable is hidden behind the local one, so we do not have access to it in this local scope).

Using this name outside the local scope means that we will be referring to the global variable.
This is not best programming practice, however, and we should avoid such situations. 
example without shadowing:
*/
let  counter  =  100;
console.log(counter);  //  ->  100
{
       counter  =  200;
       console.log(counter);  //  ->  200
}
console.log(counter);  //  ->  200

//The counter variable, declared at the beginning of the program, is a global variable.
//Throughout the program, also inside the block, we operate on this very variable.

//A small change in the code is enough for the program to behave completely differently.
let  counter  =  100;
console.log(counter);  //  ->  100
{
     let  counter  =  200;
     console.log(counter);  //  ->  200
}
console.log(counter);  //  ->  100

//This time in the block, instead of counter = 200;
//the declaration is local (itâ€™s a different scope than global) 
//and all references to the variable with this name inside the block will refer to this local variable.

//Outside the block, the global variable will still be seen under the same name.

//try to avoid giving the same variable names to multiple variables, regardless of where you declare them.
