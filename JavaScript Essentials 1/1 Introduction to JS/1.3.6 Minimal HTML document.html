            //The JavaScript code to be executed by the browser on the page must be attached to the HTML using the <script> tag
            //there are two ways it can be done.
            //The code can be embedded directly inside of the <script> tags, but this is only recommended when the code is short.
            //Another approach is to use the "src" attribute to point to a separate file that contains the JavaScript code.

            //Usually <script> tags are inserted in the page header between the <head> tags, and we can insert many of them in a file
            
            //This behavior can be changed for external scripts pointed to by the "src" attribute by using the "defer" or "async" attributes.
            //The "defer" attribute tells the browser to load the script only when the page is fully loaded.
            //El atributo "async" significa que el script se ejecutará inmediatamente, pero en paralelo al análisis del resto de la página.
            //The "defer" and "async" attributes can be used in conjunction with the "src" attribute.
