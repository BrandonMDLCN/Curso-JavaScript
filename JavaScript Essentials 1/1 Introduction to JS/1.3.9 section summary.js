//you only need to use the console with an empty page (e.g. about:blank). If you want to test a slightly larger piece of code
//about:blank, en un navegador no sera de utilidad para hacer pruebas
//it is best to create a minimal html file that will refer to the file containing our JavaScript code using the <script> tag.

//We can pass several arguments to console.log separated by commas
console.log("Brandon", "Martin", "(1999)");

//Output the same information (name, surname, year) to the console, not side by side, but on consecutive lines.
console.log("Mary"); console.log("Stuart"); console.log("(1542)");

//A string can be concatenated using the + sign, for example "abc" + "def" will be treated as "abcdef".
console.log("Mary" + "Stuart" + "(1542)");
