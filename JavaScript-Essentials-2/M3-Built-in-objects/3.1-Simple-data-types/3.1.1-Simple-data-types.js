/*--------------------- 3.1.1 Simple data types ---------------------*/

/* 
You already encountered the term data type in the previous part of the course.

In computer programming, all data is of some type.

This type is used to tell the interpreter or compiler how to treat the data.

Most commonly, data types are divided into two categories: simple (or primitive) and composite (or complex).

Simple types contain a single value, which will be interpreted as something like a number or a text.


Composite types are usually constructed from simple types, and most often are all kinds of collections (ordered or not).

Weâ€™ll now take a look at the basic JavaScript primitive types and their corresponding built-in objects.
