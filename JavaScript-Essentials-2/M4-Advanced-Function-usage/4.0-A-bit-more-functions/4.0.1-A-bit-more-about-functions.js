/*--------------------- 4.0.1 A bit more about functions ---------------------*/

/* 
During the first part of this course you learned about functions in JavaScript, and now you’ll be dealing with functions in most of the topics that follow.

After completing the first part of the course, you should now be able to declare a function, use a function expression, or create an arrow function.

Furthermore, you should have no problem calling functions, passing arguments to them, or returning their results.

However, functions in JavaScript give programmers many more possibilities.


In order to use them fully, let’s try to extend our knowledge of the subject, starting with simple things such as default parameter values, 
and ending with asynchronous execution.
