/*--------------------- 2.2.1 Properties ---------------------*/
/* 
Objects, in addition to methods, obviously contain properties.

Classes must therefore be able to define them.

This requires some additional explanation, because the original class syntax introduced into JavaScript in ECMAScript 6 
does not offer the possibility to explicitly declare properties inside the class body.

This possibility has been added relatively recently, but it is still an experimental technique.


Weâ€™ll discuss two methods of declaring a property: in the body of the constructor and methods, and an alternative, the new one, in the body of the class.

Both types of declaration can be used simultaneously in one class.
